## Preparing data for analysis

```{r, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message=FALSE}
raw_df = read_csv("data/spambase.data", col_names = FALSE)
clean_names = c("FREQ_MAKE","FREQ_ADDRESS","FREQ_ALL","FREQ_3D","FREQ_OUR","FREQ_OVER","FREQ_REMOVE","FREQ_INTERNET","FREQ_ORDER","FREQ_MAIL","FREQ_RECEIVE","FREQ_WILL","FREQ_PEOPLE","FREQ_REPORT","FREQ_ADDRESSES","FREQ_FREE","FREQ_BUSINESS","FREQ_EMAIL","FREQ_YOU","FREQ_CREDIT","FREQ_YOUR","FREQ_FONT","FREQ_000","FREQ_MONEY","FREQ_HP","FREQ_HPL","FREQ_GEORGE","FREQ_650","FREQ_LAB","FREQ_LABS","FREQ_TELNET","FREQ_857","FREQ_DATA","FREQ_415","FREQ_85","FREQ_TECHNOLOGY","FREQ_1999","FREQ_PARTS","FREQ_PM","FREQ_DIRECT","FREQ_CS","FREQ_MEETING","FREQ_ORIGINAL","FREQ_PROJECT","FREQ_RE","FREQ_EDU","FREQ_TABLE","FREQ_CONFERENCE","FREQ_;","FREQ_(","FREQ_[","FREQ_!","FREQ_$","FREQ_#","LENGTH_AVERAGE","LENGTH_LONGEST","LENGTH_TOTAL","IS_SPAM")
clean_df = setNames(raw_df, clean_names)
knitr::kable(head(clean_df[c(1,2,3,4,5,54,55,56,57,58)], 5), format="markdown", align='cc')
```

## Splitting dataframe for train and testing

We are going to split the dataframe by 85% to train dataset and use remaining 15% to control and test our prediction rate. 

```{r}
sample_size = floor(0.85 * nrow(clean_df))
set.seed(9999)

train_index <- sample(seq_len(nrow(clean_df)), size = sample_size)

train_df = clean_df[train_index, ]
test_df = clean_df[-train_index, ]
knitr::kable(head(test_df[c(1,2,3,4,5,54,55,56,57,58)], 5), format="markdown", align='cc')
```
## Building Regression Tree

```{r}
regression_tree = rpart(IS_SPAM~., data = train_df, method='class')
rpart.plot(regression_tree, type=3, box.palette = "Blues")
```
##CP Table of Regression Tree

We will check CP Table of regression tree before we prune the tree. It is not necessary to prune it here since our dataset is small but It is good practice to prune it for performance optimization.

```{r}
reg_tree_cpt = regression_tree$cptable
knitr::kable(reg_tree_cpt, format="markdown", align='cc')
```
## Measuring our prediction rate

```{r}
predict_df = predict(regression_tree, test_df, type = 'class')
prediction_table = table(test_df$IS_SPAM, predict_df)

prediction_rate = (prediction_table[1,1]+prediction_table[2,2])/sum(prediction_table)
print(paste(c('Our CART model has ',round(prediction_rate*100,2),'% correct prediction rate.'), collapse = ""))
```
